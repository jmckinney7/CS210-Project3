CS210 Project 3 - Corner Grocer Application

## CS210 Project 3 Summary
As a junior developer at Chada Tech, I was tasked with programming an application that could analyze text records based on daily purchases. These records are a list of items found in the store that was purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. Corner Grocer is interested in rearranging their produce section and needs to know the frequency of item purchases so it can create the most effective layout for their customers. This project utilized ofstream and ifstream operations, encapsulation, loops, classes, enumerations, exceptions, and handles.
